# WDT
called "weed" WDT is a watch-dog-timer system
# i assume at this time (2017) that WDT is a unix chron script (or equivelent) that:
-- wakes every second, spawn executes MOOSE Directives (via a script) and 
-- sleeps.

this ensures the minamal execution time for chron processes.

i envision WDT to be a database guard and bees system with recycling.
